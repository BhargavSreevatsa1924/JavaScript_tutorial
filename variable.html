    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

    <p>In this example, price1, price2, and total are variables.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        let carName = "MYcAR";
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
        // variable without any value assigned has the "VALUE = undefined"
    </script>

    <!-- <script>
        const price1 = 5;
        const price2 = 6;
        let total = price1 + price2;
         // let - value can be changed
        // const - value can't be changed
       // Undeclared variables are automatically declared when first used

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The total is: " + total;
    </script> -->
 <!-- After the declaration,
   the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
   let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;-> multiple decl separated by commas
   let person = "John Doe",
   carName = "Volvo",
   price = 200;-> declaration can span multiple lines

<!--
 1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you cannot use const

5. Never use var if you can use let or const.
RULES FOR THE VARIABLE DECLARATION
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

 <!-- 
 If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
 The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
 You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
 If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
 Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
